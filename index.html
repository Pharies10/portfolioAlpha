            <h1 class="background_bar_title">Background</h1>
            <p class="background_bar_summary"><img src="images/background_img.png">I am a senior computer science major at <a href="https://www.centre.edu/" target="_blank">Centre College</a> in Danville, KY. While I attend college in Kentucky, my hometown is San Diego, CA. At Centre, I am a student-athlete, balancing the academic rigor of my major with my passion for lacrosse. As an NCAA athlete, I have recieved multiple awards for academic excellence and hold one of the leading GPAs of the team.
                <br>
                <br>
            As a student athelete in high school and in college, I have developed a unique set of communication skills, work ethics, and leadership qualities that seperate me from many computer science majors. On the lacrosse field, communication and effort directly correlate with success. Being a computer science major at Centre, I have translated those skills into my work in the classroom. Every challenge in the classroom I tackle with the same determination I have learned from lacrosse, and in every programming team I try and make sure we are all on the same page during each project. I try and emulate the saying "lead by example", which has defined my work on and off the field. In the classroom, that means challenging myself to be better in every scenario I am put in.
          <!--My passion for computer science derives from the problem solving nature of it. Being able to analyze a challenging problem and build a tool to solve it drives my passion and compels me to improve.  If my athletic career has taught me anything, it is that no obstacle is so significant that I can't overcome it with hard work and determination. I approach every computer science problem with the same stubborn determination for success that I have on the field.-->

            <h1 class="background_bar_title">What I Am Doing Now</h1>
            <p class="background_bar_summary">I was scheduled to assist on a research project for Centre this summer, but due to the COVID-19 pandemic that is affecting us all, the research was canceled. Currently I am prepping for the GREs  and taking the Unreal Engine fast-track program. I hope to have a working game to show from the Unreal program by the end of the summer of 2020.</p>
